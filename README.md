## Hi, I'm Martyna ✨
I'm a student at Poznań University of Technology 🇵🇱 and a tech enthusiast who enjoys building fun and functional tools — especially when it comes to machine learning, data analysis, and making GUIs actually look good ✨

I'm also an active member of the GHOST scientific club at Politechnika Poznańska, where I lead two sections:
- Intro to ML – teaching fellow students the basics of machine learning and data analysis
- ML Next Step – diving deeper into topics like deep learning, natural language processing (NLP), and computer vision (CV)<br>

### 📍🗺️ Poznań, Poland
